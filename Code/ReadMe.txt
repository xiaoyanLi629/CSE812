1. Run Network_generation file first to generate nodes calculate possible links.
2. File "link_distance_matrix_reduced.pickle" is saved which contains five columns:
	a.The first column is link index
	b.The second column is node 1
	c.The third colunmn is node 2
	d.The fourth column is distance between nodes
	e.The fifth column is link indicator
3. Nodes_location file to plot generated nodes locations and saced the picture.
4. Nodes_distance is function file for calculating distance between tow nodes
