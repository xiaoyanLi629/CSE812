Attendance:
In general, no late work will be accepted and no makeup exam will be allowed except under very special circumstances. If you have to submit homework late or have to have a makeup exam, you must send the request to the instructor with documented proof in advance unless it is impossible.
Your grades will be available in D2L. Feel free to contact the instructor for clarifications about your grade. If you feel your grade was unfair, you may request a regrade. Regrade request must be submitted via email, within one week of receiving the original grade. Requests must detail what the student feels was unfair and why.
These are the grading elements of this course: Homework: 30%
Exam: 30%
Project: 40%
Final grades will be based on the following scale:
4.0 >= 90%; 3.5 85%; 3.0 80%; 2.5 75%; 2.0 70%; 1.5 65%; 1.0 60%.
You are expected to attend all class sessions.
Academic Honesty:
Article 2.III.B.2 of the Academic Integrity states that "the student shares with the faculty the responsibility for maintaining the integrity of scholarship, grades, and professional standards." In addition, the College of Engineering and Computer Science Department adheres to the policies on academic honesty as specified in General Student Regulations 1.0, Protection of Scholarship and Grades, and in the all-University Policy on Integrity of Scholarship and Grades, which are included in Spartan Life: Student Handbook and Resource Guide. Students who commit an act of academic dishonesty may receive a 0.0 on the assignment or in the course.
